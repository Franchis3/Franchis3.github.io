    <h1>About the Genius in Training</h1>

    <p>Hey. I'm Tyler, a software and cloud engineer hoping to use this site buildout as a way to further my technical skillset.  
      I've been looking for a productive outlet as an excuse to get deeper into full stack development, as well as the data analytics side of things.
    </p>

    <p> Cyclone basketball offers a perfect opportunity to marry those two.  See you on the other side.  Coming soon.</p>

    <h2>Progress Report</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build functional website - I think this layout speaks for itself at the moment.... not remotely done</li>
      <li>Create a beautiful website - unless you're a big fan of black and white minimalism, there's a while to go here</li>
      <li>Develop backend architecture - for what the goal is, this site should require a typical 3 tier design</li>
      <li>Paralysis by Analysis - using a growing Python skillset, analyze Cyclone basketball both past and present</li>
    </ul>
