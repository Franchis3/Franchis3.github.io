      <h3>Bio</h3>

      <p>Hey. I'm Tyler, a software and cloud engineer hoping to use this site buildout as a way to further my technical skillset.  
        I've been looking for a productive outlet for an excuse to get deeper into full stack development, as well as the data analytics side of things.
      </p>

      <p> Cyclone basketball offers a perfect opportunity to marry those two.  See you on the other side.  Coming soon.</p>

      <h3>Progress Report</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Build functional website - I think this layout speaks for itself at the moment.... not remotely done</li>
        <li>Create a beautiful website - unless you're a big fan of black and white minimalism, there's a while to go here</li>
        <li>Develop backend architecture - for what the goal is, this site should require a typical 3 tier design</li>
        <li>Paralysis by Analysis - using a growing Python skillset, analyze Cyclone basketball both past and present</li>
      </ul>
